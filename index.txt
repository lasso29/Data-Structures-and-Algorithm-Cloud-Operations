** Steps to be taken to deploy a Vite+React Application on Cpanel

1. Prepare Your Application:
   - Make sure your Vite+React application is ready for deployment and also ensure that all necessary dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file (to avoid unnecessary errors).

2. Run the build command for your Vite+React application; this command is `npm run build`. (This command compiles your React components, JavaScript files)

3. Log in to your cPanel account provided by your hosting provider, and navigate to the File Manager within your cPanel.

4. Find the directory where you want to deploy your application. Usually, this is the `public_html` directory for the main website or web application.

5. Select the option to upload files, choose your zipped folder containing the application files, and upload it to the desired directory.

6. Unzip the Folder: Once the zipped folder is uploaded, unzip it directly within the desired directory in cPanel. This can usually be done by right-clicking on the zipped folder and selecting the option to extract or unzip.

7. Move Files to Public Folder: After unzipping the folder, ensure that the files are moved to the correct location within your public folder on cPanel. The public folder serves and compiles the files so they can be shown in the browser.
