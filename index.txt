** Steps to be taken to deploy a Vite+React Application on Cpanel

1. Prepare Your Application:
   - Make sure your Vite+React application is ready for deployment and also ensure that all necessary dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file (to avoid unnecessary errors).

2. Run the build command for your Vite+React application; this command is `npm run build`. (This command compiles your React components, JavaScript files)

3. Log in to your cPanel account provided by your hosting provider, and navigate to the File Manager within your cPanel.
4. Find the directory where you want to deploy your application. Usually, this is the `public_html` directory for the main website or web application.
5. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder generated by the build process to the desired directory.
