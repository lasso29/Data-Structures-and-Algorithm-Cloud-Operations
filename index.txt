** Steps to be taken to deploy a Vite+React Application on Cpanel

1. Prepare Your Application:
   - Make sure your Vite+React application is ready for deployment.
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file (to avoid unnecessary errors)


2. Build Your Application:
   - Run the build command for your Vite+React application; this command is `npm run build`.
   - This command compiles your React components, JavaScript files, and other assets into a production-ready bundle.

3. Access Your cPanel:
   - Log in to your cPanel account provided by your hosting provider.

4. File Manager:
   - Navigate to the File Manager within your cPanel.
   - Find the directory where you want to deploy your application. Usually, this is the `public_html` directory for the main website.

5. Upload Your Application:
   - Upload the contents of the `dist` folder generated by the build process to the desired directory.
   - This folder contains the compiled and optimized files ready for deployment.
